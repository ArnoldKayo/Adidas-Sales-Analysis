# Adidas-Sales-Analysis
I did an Adidas sales analysis with the help of Excel. I was able to derive insights from the dataset and visualize the relationships with the variables with help of Pivot Tables. I was able to visualize using Line, Bar Graphs and a Filled map. Finally able to visualize all this data on a dashboard and also ensured the 'Report Connections' were working eficiently with the help of filters.
